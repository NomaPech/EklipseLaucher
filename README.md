## Downloads

You can download from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/NomaPech/EklipseLauncher/releases)

**Supported Platforms**

If you download from the [Releases](https://github.com/dscalzi/HeliosLauncher/releases) tab, select the installer for your system.

| Platform | File |
| -------- | ---- |
| Windows x64 | `eklipselauncher-setup-VERSION.exe` |
| macOS | `eklipselauncher-VERSION.dmg` |
| Linux x64 | `eklipselauncher-VERSION-x86_64.AppImage` |

## Console

To open the console, use the following keybind.

```console
ctrl + shift + i
```

Ensure that you have the console tab selected. Do not paste anything into the console unless you are 100% sure of what it will do. Pasting the wrong thing can expose sensitive information.


## Development

### Getting Started

**System Requirements**

* [Node.js][nodejs] v12

---

**Clone and Install Dependencies**

```console
> git clone https://github.com/NomaPech/EklipseLauncher.git
> cd EklipseLauncher
> npm install
```

---

**Launch Application**

```console
> npm start
```

---

**Build Installers**

To build for your current platform.

```console
> npm run dist
```

Build for a specific platform.

| Platform    | Command              |
| ----------- | -------------------- |
| Windows x64 | `npm run dist:win`   |
| macOS       | `npm run dist:mac`   |
| Linux x64   | `npm run dist:linux` |

Builds for macOS may not work on Windows/Linux and vice-versa.

---

### Visual Studio Code

All development of the launcher should be done using [Visual Studio Code][vscode].

Paste the following into `.vscode/launch.json`

```JSON
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Debug Main Process",
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
      "runtimeExecutable": "${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/.bin/electron",
      "windows": {
        "runtimeExecutable": "${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/.bin/electron.cmd"
      },
      "args": ["."],
      "console": "integratedTerminal",
      "protocol": "inspector"
    },
    {
      "name": "Debug Renderer Process",
      "type": "chrome",
      "request": "launch",
      "runtimeExecutable": "${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/.bin/electron",
      "windows": {
        "runtimeExecutable": "${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/.bin/electron.cmd"
      },
      "runtimeArgs": [
        "${workspaceRoot}/.",
        "--remote-debugging-port=9222"
      ],
      "webRoot": "${workspaceRoot}"
    }
  ]
}
```

This adds two debug configurations.

#### Debug Main Process

This allows you to debug Electron's [main process][mainprocess]. You can debug scripts in the [renderer process][rendererprocess] by opening the DevTools Window.

#### Debug Renderer Process

This allows you to debug Electron's [renderer process][rendererprocess]. This requires you to install the [Debugger for Chrome][chromedebugger] extension.

Note that you **cannot** open the DevTools window while using this debug configuration. Chromium only allows one debugger, opening another will crash the program.
